# Introduction

> <h3 class='toc-ignore'>API Endpoint</h3>
> https://api.fonoster.com/v1

Fonoster makes voice application easy by combining powerful call control, and RESTful APIs. In just minutes you 
can build, test and deploy solutions that scale at the speed of your business.

You use Javascript to control the flow of the phone call, and the REST API to originate the call, obtain analytics, manage accounts, 
create apps, configure numbers, retrieve recordings or transcriptions, and more.
